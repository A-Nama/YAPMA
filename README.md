### Project Description
YAPMA tackles the critical challenge of preventing harmful AI misuse by stopping unethical prompts at the source. We're shaping a safer, more responsible AI future—because it matters.

### The Problem statement
We're solving the absurd reality where people misuse AI to create harmful and unethical content—because honestly, who thought making AI a supervillian was a good idea? 😤 YAPMA steps in to say, "Not today, bestie!"

### The Solution
We’re giving AI a moral compass and a Gen Z vibe! 🌟 YAPMA sniffs out shady prompts, serves up sassy warnings, and stops harmful content before it even exists. Think of us as that loyal bestie your AI didn’t know it needed!
