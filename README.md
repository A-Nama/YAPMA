### Project Description
YAPMA tackles the critical challenge of preventing harmful AI misuse by stopping unethical prompts at the source. We're shaping a safer, more responsible AI future‚Äîbecause it matters.

### The Problem statement
We're solving the absurd reality where people misuse AI to create harmful and unethical content‚Äîbecause honestly, who thought making AI a supervillian was a good idea? üò§ YAPMA steps in to say, "Not today, bestie!"

### The Solution
We‚Äôre giving AI a moral compass and a Gen Z vibe! üåü YAPMA sniffs out shady prompts, serves up sassy warnings, and stops harmful content before it even exists. Think of us as that loyal bestie your AI didn‚Äôt know it needed!
